                    <p>Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East
                        Asian immigrant parents who
                        undertook the arduous journey to the
                        shores of America with the
                        intention of giving their
                        children the best future. His mother's
                        wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the
                        tastiest dishes with whatever
                        is available inexpensively at the
                        supermarket, was his first inspiration
                        to create the fusion cuisines for
                        which <em>The Frying Pan</em>
                        became well known.
                        He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines
                        to this restaurant,
                        pioneering cross-cultural
                        culinary connections.</p>

                        comes from a long established family
                        tradition in farming and produce.
                        His experiences growing up on a
                        farm in the Australian outback gave him
                        great appreciation for varieties of
                        food sources. As he puts it in

                        personally ensures that every dish
                        that we serve meets his exacting tastes.
                        Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that
                        ensues if their dish does
                        not meet his exacting standards.
